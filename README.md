#AngularJS sample

Implemented Routes, Directives, Charts.

Run application:  `npm run app`

Application url by default `localhost:8000`

Logic of data flow is fictional.
For every reload of page stub-data is generated with random values on the server side.
Use url like `host[:port]/data.json` to download data in the JSON presentation (Or you can directly get it in
`/stub-data` folder in the root directory).
